When creating a new issue, it should starts with (add, update, remove, change, move and etc.)

If you will be committing, the first word in the title should be a present participles.

Every release, the first word in the lists should only use a past participle.

Let's have an example below,
  - You'll be creating a new issue, you saw some bugs, you must title it to
    - issue#8: __fix the error regarding Foo\Bar handle function__
  - One of our contributors did some update, the commit title must be
    - commit title: __fixing the error regarding issue #8 ...__
  - We will be consolidating all the commits, and the project lead and team will be releasing a new version
    - Version major.minor.patch
      - __fixed error regarding issue #8 ... by your name here__
      - __added ...__
      - __updated ...__
      - __changed ...__
      - __etc ...__
